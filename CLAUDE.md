# CLAUDE.md - Marketplace

**Status**: Active Development
**Version**: 1.11.1
**Last Updated**: 2026-04-08

## Critical Rules

**ALWAYS** follow Claude Code plugin conventions
**ALWAYS** apply git-repo-standards and git-workflows skills to projects
**NEVER** commit credentials or API keys to the repository
**OPTIONAL** use contextd for cross-session memory (if MCP server available)

## Code Standards

- Plugin artifacts follow Claude Code conventions
- Use kebab-case for all component names
- Skills can optionally integrate with contextd (memory, remediation, checkpoints)
- Templates go in `skills/<skill-name>/templates/`
- Agents output structured JSON for consensus review integration

## Known Pitfalls

- **Hook prompts are LLM instructions, not executable code** - Variables in hooks/templates (e.g., `{{filename}}`) are documentation for the LLM, not shell interpolation
- **Template variables** use Go's `text/template` which handles escaping; they're not directly user-controlled
- **Security reviewers may flag "injection"** in prompts - this is expected; the prompts instruct the LLM what to analyze
- **Verify all SKILL.md reference file paths exist on disk** - Skills reference files in `references/` that may not have been created yet; always check before release
- **Pressure test skills before release** - Use `/fs-dev:test-skill` with adversarial scenarios; harden HIGH-risk patterns with explicit "DO NOT" / "CRITICAL" warnings in skill body
