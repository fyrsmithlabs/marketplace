Record a learning or insight from the current session.

Ask the user (if not provided):

2. Details of the learning (content)
3. Was this a success or failure?

Then call `mcp__contextd__memory_record` with:
- project_id: Current project identifier
- title: Brief title for the memory
- content: Detailed learning content
- outcome: "success" or "failure"
- tags: Relevant tags extracted from content

Confirm the memory was recorded with its ID and initial confidence.
