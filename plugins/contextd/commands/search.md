Search across memories, remediations, and code.

Take the search query from the command argument or ask the user.

1. Call `mcp__contextd__semantic_search` with:
   - query: User's search query
   - project_path: Current working directory
   - limit: 5

   (This auto-uses semantic search if indexed, falls back to grep)

2. Call `mcp__contextd__memory_search` with:
   - project_id: Current project
   - query: User's search query
   - limit: 5
   - category: (optional) Filter by category: operational, architectural, debugging, security, feature, general

3. Call `mcp__contextd__remediation_search` with:
   - query: User's search query
   - tenant_id: From git remote or default
   - limit: 5

4. Present combined results:

   **Code Found:**
   - File path, line number
   - Code snippet preview
   - Relevance score

   **Memories Found:**
   - Title, confidence, outcome, category
   - Content preview
   - Tags
   - Category distribution and detected gaps (in metadata)

   **Remediations Found:**

   - Problem summary
   - Solution preview

5. Offer to show full details for any result.
