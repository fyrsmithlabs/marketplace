## Contextd Pre-flight Reminder

Before starting work on this task, did you:

- [ ] `memory_search(project_id, "task keywords")` - Check past learnings
- [ ] `remediation_search(query)` - If this involves an error

These take seconds and often save significant time by surfacing relevant context.

**Skip only if:** This is a continuation of work already in context.
