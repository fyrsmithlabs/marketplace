## Contextd Post-flight Check

Before finishing, consider:

- [ ] `memory_record(project_id, title, content, outcome, tags)` - Did you learn something worth saving?
- [ ] `remediation_record(...)` - Did you fix an error others might encounter?
- [ ] `memory_feedback(memory_id, helpful)` - Did a past memory help you?

**Building the knowledge base helps future sessions.**

Skip only if: No new learnings or fixes occurred.
